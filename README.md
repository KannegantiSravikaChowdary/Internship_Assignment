# Internship_Assignment
Developed as part of a technical assignment on computational geometry during my internship application. This project models a MÃ¶bius Strip using parametric equations, computes surface area and edge length numerically, and visualizes the structure in 3D using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
